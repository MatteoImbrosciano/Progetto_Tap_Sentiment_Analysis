2024-01-26T13:18:13,2024-01-26T13:18:13," depends on all of us. And whether you like Facebook or not, I think we need to recognize what is at stake and come together to stand for voice and free expression at this critical moment. It's really great to be here at Georgetown with all of you today. Before we get started, I just want to take a moment to acknowledge that today we lost an icon, Elijah Cummings. He was a powerful voice for equality and for social progress and for bringing people together. Back when when I was in college, our country had just gone to war in Iraq and the mood on our campus was disbelief. A lot of people felt like we were acting without hearing a lot of important perspectives and the toll on on soldiers and their families and our national psyche was was severe yet most of us felt like we were powerless to do anything about it. And I remember feeling that if more people had a voice to share their experiences then maybe it could have gone differently. And those early years shaped my belief that giving more people a voice gives power to the powerless and pushes society to get better over time. Now back then I was just building an early version of Facebook for my community but I got a chance to see my values and beliefs play out at a smaller scale. When students got to express who they were and what mattered to them, they started more student groups, they organized more businesses and they even challenged some established ways of doing things around campus. And it taught me the lesson that while a lot of the world often focuses on the big events and institutions, the bigger story is that most progress in our lives actually comes from individuals having more of a voice. So since then I've focused on building services that do two things. Give people a voice and bring people together. And these two simple ideas of voice and inclusion go hand in hand. And we've seen this throughout history even if it doesn't always seem that way today. And more people being able to share their experiences and perspectives has always been necessary to build a more inclusive society. And it is our commitment to each other that we hold each other's right to express ourselves and be heard above our own desire to always get our way in every debate. That's how we make progress together. But this view is increasingly being challenged. Now some people believe that giving more people a voice is driving division rather than bringing people together. More people across the spectrum believe that achieving the political outcomes that they think matter is more important than every person having a voice and being heard. And I think that that's dangerous. So today I want to talk about why and some of the important choices around free expression that I think that we face going forward. Throughout history we've seen how being able to use your voice, how people being able to use their voice helps people come together. And we've seen this in the civil rights movement. Frederick Douglas once called free expression the great moral renovator of our society. He said slavery cannot tolerate free speech. Civil rights leaders argued time and again that their protests were a protected form of expression. And one noted that nearly all of the cases involving the civil rights movement were decided on First Amendment grounds. We've seen this globally too where the ability to speak freely has been central to the fight for democracy worldwide. The most repressive societies have always restricted speech the most and when people are finally able to speak they often use their voice to call for change. In this year alone people have used their voices to end multiple long running dictatorships in Northern Africa and were already starting to hear from people whose voices had been excluded just because they were women or because they believed in democracy. Now our idea of free expression has become much broader over even the last hundred years. Many Americans know about the Enlightenment history and how we enshrine the First Amendment into our Constitution but few know just how dramatically our cultural norms and legal protections have expanded even in recent history. The first Supreme Court case to seriously consider free speech in the First Amendment was in 1919, shank versus the United States. And now back then the First Amendment only applied to the federal government so states could and often did restrict your right to speak. Our ability to call out things that we felt were wrong also used to be a lot more restricted. You know libel laws used to impose damages if you said something negative about someone even if it was true. The standard then shifted so that way it was okay as long as you could prove that your critique was true. And we didn't get the broad free speech protections that we have now until the 1960s when the Supreme Court ruled in opinions like New York Times or Sullivan that you can criticize public figures as long as you're not doing so with actual malice even if what you're saying is false. So we don't have significantly broader power to call out things that we feel are unjust and share our own personal experiences. And we see movements like Black Lives Matter and Me Too spreading and go viral on Facebook. The hashtag Black Lives Matter was actually mentioned for the first time on Facebook. And this just wouldn't have been possible in the same way before. You know just a hundred years back many of the stories that people are sharing now would have been against the law to even write down. And of course without the internet they certainly wouldn't have reached so many people. So with Facebook today more than two billion people now have a greater opportunity to express themselves and to help others. Now while it's easy to focus on the big social movements I think it's important to remember that most progress happens in our individual lives. It's the Air Force moms who start a Facebook group so that their children and other service members who can't come home for the holidays have a place to go. It's the church group that comes together after the hurricane to provide food and to volunteer to help rebuild. It's the small business on the corner that now has access to the same sophisticated tools that only the big guys used to have access to. So now they can get their voice out to reach customers, create more jobs in their town and become a social hub in their community. Progress and social cohesion come from billions of stories like this happening all around the world. People having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world. It is a fifth estate alongside the other power structures in our society. And you know people no longer have to rely on traditional gatekeepers in politics or media to make their voices heard and that has important consequences. And I understand the concerns that people have about how tech platforms have centralized power. But I actually believe that the much bigger story is how much these platforms have decentralized power by putting it directly into people's hands. It's part of this amazing expansion of voice that we've experienced through law and culture and now technology as well. So giving people a voice and broader inclusion go hand in hand. And the trend has certainly been towards us getting much greater voice over time. But there's also an important counter trend which is that in times of social tension our impulse is often to pull back on free expression because we want the progress that comes from free expression but we don't want the tension. We saw this when Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his famous letter from a Birmingham jail where he was unconstitutionally jailed for protesting peacefully. And we saw this in the effort to shut down campus protests during the Vietnam War. We saw this way back when America was deeply polarized about its role in World War One and the Supreme Court ruled at the time that the socialist leader Eugene Debs could be imprisoned for making an anti-war speech. In the end all of these decisions were wrong. Pulling back on free expression wasn't the answer and in fact it often ends up hurting the minority views that we seek to protect. Now from where we are today it seems obvious that of course protests for civil rights or making a speech against a war should be allowed yet this desire to suppress this expression was felt deeply by a lot of society at the time. And today we are in another moment of social tension. We face real issues that are going to take a long time to work through. Massive economic transitions from globalization and technology. Fallout that remains from the 2008 financial crisis. Very polarized reactions to social issues and greater migration not just here but across the EU and around the world. And many of our issues flow downstream from these changes. And in the face of these tensions once again a popular impulse is to pull back on free expression. We are at another crossroads. We can either continue to stand for free expression understanding its messiness but believing that the long journey towards greater progress requires confronting ideas that challenge us. Or we can decide that the cost is simply too great. And I'm here today because I believe that we must continue to stand for free expression. Now at the same time I know that free expression has never been absolute. There are some people who argue that internet platforms should allow all expression that is protected under the First Amendment even though the First Amendment explicitly doesn't apply to companies. I'm proud that our values at Facebook are inspired by the American tradition which is more supportive of free expression than anywhere else in the world. But even American tradition recognizes that some speech infringes on other people's rights rules about what you can and can't say often have unintended consequences. You know when speech restrictions were implemented in the UK in the last century parliament noted that they were often applied more heavily to citizens from poorer backgrounds because the way they expressed things didn't match the elite Oxbridge style. And I believe that in everything we do we need to make sure that we are empowering people and not simply reinforcing existing institutions and power structures. So that brings us back to the crossroads that we find ourselves at today. Are we going to continue fighting to give more people a voice to be heard? Or are we going to pull back from free expression? Now I see three major threats ahead. The first is legal. We're increasingly seeing laws and regulations around the world that undermine free expression in people's human rights. And these local laws are each individually troubling especially when they shut down speech in places where there isn't democracy or freedom of the press. But it's even worse when countries try to impose their speech restrictions on the rest of the world. This raises the larger question about the future of our global internet. China is building its own internet focused on very different values and it's now exporting their vision of the internet to other countries. Now until recently the internet almost every country outside of China has been defined by American platforms with strong free expression values. But there's no guarantee that these values will win out. A decade ago almost all of the major internet platforms were American. Today six of the top ten are Chinese. And we're beginning to see this in social media too. While our services like WhatsApp are used by protesters and activists everywhere due to strong encryption and privacy protections on TikTok the Chinese app growing quickly around the world mentions of these same protests are censored even here in the US. Is that the internet that we want? So this is one of the reasons why we don't operate Facebook, Instagram or our other services in China. I wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world and I thought maybe we could help create a more open society. This is something that I worked hard on for a long time but we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there and they never let us in. And now we have more freedom to speak out and stand up for the values that we believe in and fight for free expression around the world. So this question of which nations values are going to determine what speeches allowed for decades to come really puts into perspective our debates about the content issues of the day. Because while we may disagree on exactly where to draw the line on specific issues we at least can disagree. That's what free expression is. And the fact that we can even have this conversation means that we're at least debating from some common values. If another nation's platform set the rules our discourse can be defined by a completely different set of values. So to push back on this as our policy makers work to define internet policy and regulation to address public safety and the important social issues I think that we should also be proactive and write policy that helps the values of voice and expression triumph around the world. The second challenge to expression is from the platforms themselves including the platforms that are the most important to us. Because the reality is that we make a lot of decisions that affect people's ability to speak. Now I'm committed to the values that we're discussing today but we won't always get it right. I understand that people are concerned about how much control we have over how people communicate on our services. And I understand people are concerned about how much control we have over how our ideas are treated fairly. And frankly I don't think that we should be making so many important decisions about speech on our own either. And we benefit from a more democratic process and clearer rules for the internet and some new institutions. So that's why we're establishing an independent oversight board for people to appeal our content decisions. The board is going to have the power to make final binding decisions on how our content stays up or comes down across our services. And these are going to be decisions that our team and I cannot overturn. And we're going to appoint members to this board who have a diversity of views and backgrounds but who each hold free expression as a paramount value. And building this institution is important to me personally because I'm not sure what the board is going to be here. And I want to ensure that these values of voice and free expression are enshrined deeply into how this company is governed. And the third challenge to expression is the hardest because it actually comes from our culture itself. We were at a moment of particular tension here and around the world and we were seeing the impulse to restrict speech and enforce new norms on what people can and cannot say. And increasingly, we're seeing people across the spectrum try to define more speech is dangerous because it may lead to political outcomes that they see as unacceptable. Some hold the view that since the stakes are now so high, they can no longer trust their fellow citizens with the power to communicate and to decide what to believe for themselves. I personally believe that this is more dangerous for democracy over the long term than almost any speech. Democracy depends on the idea that we hold each other's right to express ourselves and be heard above our desire to always get the outcomes that we want. You can't impose tolerance top down. It has to come from people opening up, sharing experiences, and developing a shared story for our society that we all feel like we're a part of. That's how we make progress. So how do we turn the tide? Well, someone once told me that our founding fathers thought that free expression was like air. You don't miss it until it's gone. When people don't feel like they can express themselves, they lose faith in democracy and are more likely to support populist parties that prioritize specific policy outcomes over the health of our democratic and civic norms. I'm a little more optimistic. I don't think we need to lose our freedom of expression to realize how important it is. I think that people get it and understand and appreciate the voice that they have now. At some fundamental level, I think that most people believe in their fellow people too. As long as our governments respect people's right to express themselves, as long as our platforms live up to their responsibilities to support expression and prevent harm, and as long as we all commit to being open and making space for more perspectives, I think we're going to make progress. It's going to take time, but I think that we're going to work through this moment. We overcame deep polarization after World War I and intense political violence in the 1960s. Progress isn't linear. Sometimes we have to take two steps forward and one step back, but if we can't agree to let each other talk about the issues, then we can't even take the first step. Even when it's hard, this is how we build a shared understanding. So yes, we have big disagreements, maybe more now than at any time in recent history, but part of this is because we're getting our issues out on the table, issues that for a long time weren't talked about enough. More people from more parts of our society now have a voice than ever before, and it's going to take time to hear all these voices and knit them together into a coherent narrative. Sometimes we hope for a singular event to come along and resolve these conflicts, but that's never been how it works. We focus on the major institutions, our government, the large companies, but the bigger story has always been regular people using their voice to take billions of individual steps forward to make all of our lives and our communities better. The future depends on all of us, and whether you like Facebook or not, I think we need to recognize what is at stake and come together to stand for voice and free expression at this critical moment. I believe in giving people a voice because at the end of the day, I believe in people. And as long as enough of us keep fighting for this, I believe that more people's voices will eventually help us work through these issues together and write a new chapter in our history where from all of our individual voices and perspectives, we can bring the world closer together.

Where do you want to go? What's up to this weekend? Ooh, could you answer these questions in English? In today's English lesson, you will practice speaking with me about seven of the most common conversation topics in English. We will practice vocabulary, questions, sample conversation, plus you will have the chance to have a sample conversation, practice conversation with me too. Over the past year, I have made seven Speak With Me lessons, and today I have combined them all in a very useful lesson where you can practice them for the next two hours. To help you never forget what you've learned, I've created a gigantic free PDF worksheet using all of the vocabulary, phrases, questions, sample sentences, and some challenge questions so that you can never forget what you've learned. You can download this free PDF worksheet with the link in the description. All right, are you ready to get started? We're going to be talking about these topics today. So drum roll, let's get started with the first one, weekend plans. Are you ready to learn the most important conversation question of all time, at least according to me? Is that question, what's your name? No. Is that question, will you give me money? No. Is that question, do you love me? No, no, no. The most important conversation question is, there's actually two parts, what about you? How about you?

2024-01-26T13:37:29,2024-01-26T13:37:29," Four years ago yesterday, there was a shooting at my younger sister, Jenny's high school. Sog is high school in Santa Clarita, California. Jenny was lucky enough to see kids running when she was about to be dropped off by her car pool so she stayed safe. But all of her friends were placed on lockdown. Kids I've watched grow up and have known for as long as I can remember. In the hours that followed, parents waited at my city's Central Park to reunite with their kids as students were released building by building, escorted by police and swap teams to the park. Three days later, there was a vigil at that same Central Park to honor Gracie Mealberger and Dominic Blackwell, whose parents laid them to rest at the tender ages of 15 and 14. It was the largest gathering in my city's history. Despite the divisions in my hometown, we stood at peace as one another that night, yearning for a better future. This very American tragedy that we have had to witness time and time again speaks to a larger issue about democracy. Like many people in the face of tragedy, I wanted to do something. And to do something, to truly participate in democracy, we have to acknowledge that injustice is cyclical and that any fight of a neighbor is the fight of our own. But how do we, wherever we may be with whatever tools we have, fight that fight? I've realized over the course of growing up that what we largely consider to be participating in democracy is honestly kind of narrow and unimaginative. We're taught that we can vote and run for office, which are both important, but what about those of us who can't because of our age, our immigration status, our class, not to mention the countless others facing disenfranchisement through voter suppression? The truth is, any of us of any age living in some semblance of a democracy or striving towards it, possess the tools to have a voice in our governments and communities. It's just a matter of learning how to have agency with those tools. For me, that's been coding and social media. It's unconventional, but I found the most success in having an influence by using whatever is in front of me, really tuning in to my networks and communities, meeting people where they're at, and centering joy and fun wherever I can. And it works. Let me explain. In the case of this school shooting, the parents of Gracie Milberger and Dominic Blackwell began a push to have the two of them memorialized at the entrance of our central park. To me, and much of my community, this memorial was a no-brainer. To others, it was grandiose and highly inappropriate. That's a direct quote, by the way. And a number of local officials agreed with them, but that cannot and should not nullify the needs and the wants of the greater community. So Gracie and Dominic's parents determined to properly memorialize their children, created a petition and organized efforts to push our city council to approve the memorial. The petition got over 10,000 signatures and people emailed the city in masses. Eventually, they approved. And we all thought we were done. But as it turns out, the land that Central Park is on is owned by the Santa Clarita Water Board, so they have the final say. And the committee created to advise on that decision penned a seven-page paper on why they should actually reject the memorial. And we didn't even know about this or know this was still up for debate until the day they were supposed to vote on it. I was so unbelievably angry. How is it that the community can come together, organize, and finally get a win just for it to be rendered fruitless by a vocal minority with fancy titles? I wasn't having it, but I still felt powerless. I wasn't on the committee. I wasn't an elected official. I couldn't even tell you what a water board did. But like I said, I had these two sources of power, coding and social media, maybe thinking, girl, like, OK? But follow me here. Follow me here. I learned to code when I was 15 at a Code of Closy Summer program where I learned that I could apply that skill to anything and everything. And on the content side of things, I got bored during the pandemic and loved giving my unsolicited opinion and yelling on the internet. So I got a pretty sizable following on TikTok and joined the organization Gen Z for Change in posting content to mobilize my generation to vote in the 2020 election. So I knew that with these two powers I held, I could do something. I could make something real in the three or so hours I had. So I got to work. I found an email address where people could send public comments on agenda items and coded a tool where people could just put in their name, affiliation, anything else they wanted to send. A randomly generated email would be created. All they had to do was push send. I finished it like 15 minutes before the deadline. It was one of the ugliest websites I had ever made. I posted it to Instagram, Twitter, TikTok. I had around 150,000 followers at the time. I sent it to my family. My sister sent it to her friends, who sent it to their friends. And then I held my breath. A few hours later, the water board voted nine to three to approve the memorial. And I felt at ease. It wasn't until a few months later, though, that I learned that out of the 63 comments submitted, 56, the vast majority, were sent using the tool that I had coded. Which is so insane because there was so little time people were able to use it in the first place. This success was a testament to the fact that so often people want to speak out. They want to do something, but don't know how or get discouraged in the face of bureaucracy. Making it a little bit easier for folks needs to be a core value for all of us. In another instance, Virginia Governor Glenn Yonkin created a tip line to report critical race theory being taught in schools. I had a problem with that. So I wanted there to be an easy, fun, community-oriented way to get this tip line taken down as soon as possible. So I coded a tool that allowed people to send song lyrics and lines from the B movie to the tip line. Essentially, it takes the name of a real school, a real city in Virginia, and spits out a very ridiculous report. For example, I have reason to believe Thomas Jefferson High School is teaching race. I overheard a teacher saying, shoddy had them apple bottom jeans. Yeah. It's silly. It's goofy. It's just as unserious as the creation of a teacher reporting tip line itself, which is exactly what draws people to this kind of action. Democracy is just more fun and inviting when you take it into your own hands. After I finished the website, I sent it to my friends at Gen Z for change. We all posted videos. Thousands of emails were sent from every state in the country and virtually every continent. And we had emails bouncing within 48 hours. Months later, the tip line was quietly officially shut down. Didn't even last a year. Because of the skills of a few, the platforms of many, and the will of hundreds of thousands of meddling kids unified in our intolerance of injustice, we were far more powerful than a couple people in official positions of power. Now, I'm not asking y'all to drop everything and learn how to code, even though I definitely think you should. Coding is part of my power, right? But power manifests differently to different people. If you have a pen, write something. If you have an instrument, play something. If you have the anger of a thousand sons and disposable income, open your purse. And if you have social media and a smartphone, I know that y'all do, so don't try me. Tell a story and let it spread like wildfire. And while it's true that a subset of people use their skills for hateful, nefarious, less-than-democratic purposes, the sheer existence of this subset requires that we think of more innovative and creative ways to ensure that the voices of the masses are genuinely heard and accounted for. Now, every time I'm home and I walk by Central Park and see the new signage, I'm reminded of the power our anguish, our joy, our stories, and our unity holds. We were able to change my community forever and for the better, all by causing a ruckus on the Internet. The stability of democracy internationally requires that we use whatever skills and resources we have to combat hate, bring movements to life, and stand united in solidarity with one another on every corner of the globe. Justice can't wait, so take what's in front of you, get really creative, and cause a ruckus.",457.8254158496857,"Four years ago yesterday, there was a shooting at my younger sister, Jenny's high school.

2024-01-26T13:41:24,2024-01-26T13:41:24," Thank you for such a wonderful introduction. Great. I'm here today to talk about motivation. And I've learned in my few years on this earth that motivation is really the key to affecting change in anything that you do. You can put a paper that was written without any motivation, without any effort, and you can put a paper that was written with drive and passion next to each other, and it's clear which one is the winner. Motivation is the underlying factor. I believe in everything that we do on a daily basis. If you don't have motivation in something that you do, then you really can't achieve what it is that you want to achieve. Everyone has motivation for things that they're passionate about, things that interest you, things that inspire you. And of course you'll have motivation if you play a sport, if you're in drama, if you're in band, you'll have motivation to accomplish that task. But the true test of finding motivation is if you can find it in something that doesn't interest you. Personally I'm interested in sitting through town council meetings and reading the 404 page town of our municipal budget. But others might not find so much paper so interesting. However, motivation can be found in everything that you do. I like to look at it in terms of finding motivation as just putting yourself in someone else's shoes. When you're questioning why do I have to do this, why do I have to put in the time, why do I have to put in the effort, you can just look at what you're doing and say this helps this person because. This person is going to appreciate my effort and my motivation on this task because. I've always found that that appreciation that others have for the effort that you put in, that's what motivates me, the fact that someone's going to appreciate what I did. So when the teacher gives you a paper or something to do and you say this is stupid, I have better things to do, I'd much rather go outside and throw a football, whatever it is, look at it and say this person is going to appreciate the work. This person put in the effort to create the assignment, now they're going to see it and they're going to appreciate it. And I do that in every assignment that I'm given and everything that is ever brought before me and that's always something that I think we need to go out and look at when we go out to tackle an issue. Filing papers, people might not find it interesting but think about how much help you're doing to somebody else, think about the responsibility that you're helping someone else fulfill. And that sort of help and appreciation motivates you. For me, fine dressing is something that I like to do every single day and I don't just do it because I enjoy it, I do it because people appreciate it, people see that, I took the extra time to prepare myself for whatever it is that I'm doing and they thank me for it. And that thanks, that appreciation is truly what motivates me to go out and do whatever it is that is put before me. So I want to finish briefly just by saying that motivation is so important in anything that you do and without it you really can't accomplish what you want but with it you have the passion to effect change, you have the passion to make a difference and you really do have the passion to go out and change the way things are done and make a difference in anything that you want to do. Thank you for your time and your ears. Thank you.",156.3263123035431,"And I've learned in my few years on this earth that motivation is really the key to affecting change in anything that you do.

2024-01-26T13:44:43,2024-01-26T13:44:43," A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut. So I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock, and try something new for 30 days. The idea is actually pretty simple. Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days. It turns out, 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit, like watching the news from your life. There's a few things that I learned while doing these 30-day challenges. The first was, instead of the months flying by forgotten, the time was much more memorable. This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month, and I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day. I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges, my self-confidence grew. I went from desk dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work for fun. Even last year, I ended up hiking up Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges. I also figured out that if you really want something badly enough, you can do anything for 30 days. Have you ever wanted to write a novel? Every November, tens of thousands of people try to write their own 50,000-word novel from scratch in 30 days. It turns out all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month. So I did. By the way, the secret is not to go to sleep until you've written your words for the day. You might be sleep-deprived, but you'll finish your novel. Now, is my book the next great American novel? No! I wrote it in a month! It's awful! But for the rest of my life, if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party, I don't have to say, I'm a computer scientist. No, no. If I want to, I can say, I'm a novelist. So here's one last thing I'd like to mention. I learned that when I made small, sustainable changes, things I could keep doing, they were more likely to stick. There's nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges. In fact, they're a ton of fun, but they're less likely to stick. When I gave up sugar for 30 days, Day 31 looked like this. So here's my question to you. What are you waiting for? I guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not. So why not think about something you have always wanted to try and give it a shot for the next 30 days? Thanks.",157.3632020950317,"So I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock, and try something new for 30 days.

2024-01-26T13:50:36,2024-01-26T13:50:36," When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding. Teaching. I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools. And like any teacher, I made quizzes and tests, I gave out homework assignments. When the work came back, I calculated grades. What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students. Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores. Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well. And that got me thinking. The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure, they're hard. Ratios, decimals, the area of a parallelogram. But these concepts are not impossible. And I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough. After several more years of teaching, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological perspective. In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ. But what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily? So I left the classroom and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist. I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings. And in every study, my question was, who is successful here and why? My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy. We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out. We went to the national spelling bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition. We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods, asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year. And of those, who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students? We partnered with private companies asking which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs? And who is going to earn the most money? In all those very different contexts, one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success. And it wasn't social intelligence. It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ. It was grit. Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint. A few years ago, I started studying grit in the Chicago Public Schools. I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate. Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate, even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure, things like family income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt when they were at school. So it's not just at West Point or the national spelling bee that grit matters. It's also in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out. To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows about building it. Every day, parents and teachers ask me, how do I build grit in kids? What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic? How do I keep them motivated for the long run? The honest answer is, I don't know. What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty. Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments. In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent. So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset. This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort. Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to persevere when they fail because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition. So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit, but we need more. And that's where I'm going to end my remarks, because that's where we are. That's the work that stands before us. We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions, and we need to test them. We need to measure whether we've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned. In other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier. Thank you.",277.2364587783813,"When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding.

2024-01-26T14:00:06,2024-01-26T14:00:06," The human voice. It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world. Probably it's the only one that can start a war or say, I love you. And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people don't listen to them. Why is that? How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world? What I'd like to suggest there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking. I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list, but these seven I think are pretty large. Habits that we can all fall into. First, gossip. Speaking ill of somebody who's not present. Not a nice habit and we know perfectly well the person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us. Second, judging. We know people who are like this in conversation and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time. Third, negativity. You can fall into this. My mother in the last years of her life became very, very negative and it's hard to listen. I remember one day I said to her, it's October the first today and she said, I know, isn't it dreadful? It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative. Another form of negativity, complaining. This is the national art of the UK. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather, about sport, about politics, about everything. But actually complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blame thrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions. And again, hard to listen to somebody who's being like that. Penultimate, the sixth of the seven. Embroidery. Exaggeration. It demeans our language actually sometimes. For example, if I see something that really is awesome, what do I call it? And then of course this exaggeration becomes lying, out and out lying and we don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us. And finally dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind. Somebody is bombarding you with their opinions. As if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are, seven deadly sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive way to think about this? Yes there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones, foundations that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world. Fortunately these things spell a word. The word is hail and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition, to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is I think how our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The H, honesty of course. Being true in what you say, being straight and clear. The A is authenticity, just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity, being your word, actually doing what you say and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people well. For two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean, my goodness, you look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously. So hail. Now, that's what you say. And it's like the old song. It is what you say. It's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible. And yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now. And just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with, which will increase the power of your speaking. Register for example. Now, falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time. But there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice, however. So if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference if I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference? We vote for politicians with lower voices. It's true. Because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's a register. And we have timbre. It's the way your voice feels. Again, the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. Well, if that's not you, that's not the end of the world. Because you can train. Go and get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture, and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice. Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing song, the meta language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's Route 1 for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word monotonic comes from, monotonous, monotone. Also we have repetitive prosody now coming in, where every sentence ends as if it were a question. When it's actually not a question, it's a statement. If you repeat that one over and over, it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody, which I think is a shame. So let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very, very excited by saying something really, really quickly, or I can slow right down to emphasize. And at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk, is there? We don't have to fill it with ums and ours. Can be very powerful. Of course pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? Where did you leave my keys? It's a slightly different meaning in those two deliveries. And finally volume. I can get really excited by using volume, sorry about that, if I startled anybody. But I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time, try not to do that. That's called sod casting. Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately, not nice. Of course, where this all comes into play, most of all, is when you've got something really important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing marriage, asking for a raise, a wedding speech, whatever it is. If it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on. And no engine works well without being warmed up. Warm up your voice. Actually, let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warm up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do. Any time you're going to talk to anybody important, do these. First arms up. Deep breath in and sigh out. Like that. One more time. Very good. Now we're going to warm up our lips and we're going to go... Very good. And now... Just like when you were a kid. Now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. Beautiful. You're getting really good at this. And then roll an R. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally, and if I can only do one, the pros call this the siren. It's really good. It starts with we and goes to all. The we is high, the all is low. So you go... Wee! Oh! Wee! Fantastic. Give yourselves a round of applause. Thank you. Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well into people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics. I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were actually fit for purpose? Or to make that a bit larger, what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound? That would be a world that does sound beautiful and one where understanding would be the norm and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",525.8167674541473,"Probably it's the only one that can start a war or say, I love you.

2024-01-26T16:53:34,2024-01-26T16:53:34," Sleep is so important. We need it to live. And when we can't sleep, we're desperate for help. But lately, our fascination with sleep feels as if it's taken on an urgency. Do a quick internet search for sleep and you'll find a slew of articles about how to make your sleep perfect. New gadgets, fancy alarm clocks, stay away from blue light. There are lots of services, products, and advice columns that tell us we're sleeping wrong. Not enough. Not quality sleep. Wrong position. Even worse, you might find scary messaging, claiming that if you're not sleeping right, your life is going to be shorter. You're going to get all kinds of diseases. One of the biggest worries we have about our sleep is that we're not getting enough. And that anything less than seven hours a night means that we're doomed to bad health. Everything from high blood pressure to Alzheimer's disease. But there are two flaws with this kind of messaging. The first flaw is that it's not completely accurate. Seven to eight hours of sleep, while recommended for adults, is just an average. And while messages have to be simplified for health communication to the public, sometimes important nuances get lost. So yes, it's true that not getting enough sleep in the long term is associated with health problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and depression. But fixating solely on seven to eight hours ignores the fact that there's a range of sleep that people need. The duration of a good night's sleep can be different for different people. Some adults need eight, but some are just fine on six. The second flaw with this kind of doomsday messaging is that it can be counterproductive, especially for people who do have trouble sleeping. For instance, in 2019, it was estimated that 21% of adults in the U.S. were wearing sleep tracking devices, and that number is probably growing. And I get it. It's fascinating to see how much sleep you've gotten each night and to know what part of your night was spent in deep sleep or dreaming. But having all of that sleep data is causing some people to become obsessed with it. It's so much so that it's leading to a condition some call orthosomnia, a preoccupation with the constant need to achieve perfect sleep. And this condition, ironically, is causing more sleep problems. Now, orthosomnia might be an extreme example, but the anxiety of not getting enough sleep is keeping some of us up at night. So here's what some experts are saying. Stop fixating on the number, because that can lead to unrealistic expectations of sleep. According to Dr. Colleen Carney, a psychologist and the head of the Ryerson University sleep lab, the basic questions you should ask yourself are, do I feel reasonably well rested during the day? Do I generally sleep through the night without disturbances? Or if I wake, do I fall back asleep easily? Can I stay awake through the day without involuntarily falling asleep? If your answers are yes to all three, you probably don't need to worry about your sleep. And if you're struggling with your sleep, instead of buying expensive blue light filters or fancy sleep trackers, try talking with your doctor to make sure there aren't any medical conditions that need to be explored first. Then try evidence-based recommendations laid out by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. What's really cool is that there's a highly effective therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, or CBTI. It doesn't have any medications involved, and it has a really low failure rate.",179.5984337329865,"But lately, our fascination with sleep feels as if it's taken on an urgency.

2024-01-26T16:56:51,2024-01-26T16:56:51," This is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students cut down to three minutes. And it all started one day on a plane on my way to Ted seven years ago. And in the seat next to me was a high school student, a teenager, and she came from a really poor family. And she wanted to make something of her life. And she asked me a simple little question. She said, what leads to success? And I felt really badly because I couldn't give her a good answer. So I get off the plane and I come to Ted. And I think, geez, I'm in the middle of a room of successful people. So why don't I ask them what helped them succeed and pass it on to kids? So here we are seven years, 500 interviews later, and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success and makes Ted's just tick. And the first thing is passion. Freeman Thomas says I'm driven by my passion. Ted's just do it for love. They don't do it for money. Carol Colletta says I would pay someone to do what I do. The interesting thing is if you do it for love, the money comes anyway. Work. Rupert Murdoch said to me it's all hard work. Nothing comes easily. But I have a lot of fun. Did he say fun, Rupert? Yes. Tedsters do have fun working and they work hard. I figured they're not workaholics. They're workaholics. Good. Alice Garden says to be successful, put your nose down in something and get damn good at it. There's no magic. It's practice, practice, practice. And it's focused. Norma Jouis said to me I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing. And push. David Gallo says push yourself. Physically, mentally, you've got to push, push, push. You've got to push through shyness and self-doubt. Goldie Hahn says I always had self-doubts. I wasn't good enough. I wasn't smart enough. I didn't think I'd make it. Now it's not always easy to push yourself and that's why they invented mothers. Frank Geary. Frank Geary said to me my mother pushed me. Serve. Sure when Newland says it was a privilege to serve as a doctor. Now a lot of kids tell me they want to be millionaires. And the first thing I say to them is okay, well you can't serve yourself. You've got to serve others something of value because that's the way people really get rich. Ideas. Ted Sturbull Gates says I had an idea. Founding the first microcomputer software company. I'd say it was a pretty good idea. And there's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas. It's just doing some very simple things. And I give lots of evidence. Persist. Joe Krauss says persistence is the number one reason for our success. You've got to persist through failure. You've got to persist through crap, which of course means criticism, rejection, assholes and pressure. So the big answer to this question is simple. Pay 4,000 bucks and come to Ted. Or failing that. Do the eight things and trust me these are the big eight things that lead to success. Thank you, Ted Sturbull Gates for all your interview. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Reports say many of the speakers called for organized violence against Muslims and hinted at a Myanmar-type cleansing campaign. There was a threat that if the government resisted the formation of a Hindu rastra, there will be an 1857-like revolt against the state. Political parties and concerned citizens have termed these as hate speech. They have demanded legal action against those involved in the propagation of hate and violence. There is no specific legal definition of hate speech. Provisions in law criminalize speeches, writings, actions, science and representations that instigate violence and spread disharmony between communities and groups. These are understood to refer to hate speech. The Law Commission of India in its 267th report says, Hate speech generally is an incitement to hatred primarily against a group of persons defined in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious belief and the like. Thus, hate speech is any word written or spoken, signs, visible representations within the hearing or sight of a person with the intention to cause fear or alarm or incitement to violence. In general, hate speech is considered a limitation on free speech that seeks to prevent or bar speech that exposes a person or a group or section of society to hate, violence, ridicule or indignity. Sections 153A and 505 of the Indian Penal Code are generally taken to be the main penal provisions that seek to punish hate speech and which deal with inflammatory speeches and expressions. Under section 153A, promotion of enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony is an offence punishable with three years' imprisonment. It attracts a five-year term if committed in a place of worship or an assembly engaged in religious worship or religious ceremonies. Section 505 of IPC makes it an offence to make statements conducing to public mischief. The statement, publication, report or rumor that is penalized under section 505 subsection 1 should be one that promotes mutiny by the armed forces or causes such fear or alarm that people are induced to commit an offence against the state or public tranquility or is intended to incite or incites any class or community to commit an offence against another class or community. This attracts a jail term of up to three years. Under 505 subsection 2, it is an offence to make statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill will between classes. Under subsection 3, the same offence will attract up to a five-year jail term if it takes place in a place of worship or in any assembly engaged in religious worship or religious ceremonies. The law commission has proposed that separate offenses be added to the IPC to criminalize hate speech quite specifically instead of being subsumed in the existing sections concerning inflammatory acts and speeches.",159.5771322250366,"A religious conclave held between December 17 and 19, 2021 in Haridwar witnessed infremitry and provocative speeches by proponents of Hindutva, many of them leaders of religious organizations.

Chi ha detto che si sono stati tozzi? Questo lo fa geologo. Ma lascia stare geologo. Non ti permetto di fare una cosa del genere. Sono 10 miliardi di tue. Il geologo tozzi stima le riserve di uranio al mondo. Allora, tu fai l'economista e vuoi centrare i nucleari solo perché ci guadagni, questo stai facendo. Allora, fammi dire a me quello che ti dico. Ma cosa si guadagni? Ci guadagni perché le banche d'affari fanno affari con nucleari. L'unice che guadagna con le centrare i nucleari sono i grandi coppiali. Se ti sei costruito una professione su questa roba, ti faccio piacere. No, se io non metto in discussione la competenza agli altri, vorrei che non si mettesse in discussione lì. Non lo stimoli, le stime attuali delle riserve uranie sono fra 50 e 70 anni. Pieghiamo 60 di media. 250 anni. Se tu fai appunto l'economista non dare numeri a casa. Allora, quello che stimano tutti quanti, a meno che non sia come per la stima del piccolo del petrolio che la stima di i petroliere certamente, allora fa comodo dire che dura di più. In questo caso sono queste. Se tu hai i più centrali consumi più energiano, più uranio, dunque durerà di meno. Se una centrale dura come dice battaglia a 60 anni vuol dire che non arrivi nemmeno a usarla tutta perché non avrai il nuclearo. Non dà un ritorno a fare. Seconda cosa, secondo cosa, quello che diceva a vero neve, si appunto, è sbagliata la filosofia di andare incontro ancora alle energie che sono i sauribili. Non dico che sia necessario insolare come si diceva prima, io non ho mai sostenuto che quella è alternativa. Non ci penso proprio nemmeno minimamente. Però certamente questa strada non porta tanto contano ancora. Magari ci porterà in un futuro, l'abbiamo detto, l'abbiamo visto più volte. Una quarta generazione è probabilmente più sicura, addirittura che avrà bisogno di meno uranio e produrrà meno scorie.

Reports say many of the speakers called for organized violence against Muslims and hinted at a Myanmar-type cleansing campaign. There was a threat that if the government resisted the formation of a Hindu rastra, there will be an 1857-like revolt against the state. Political parties and concerned citizens have termed these as hate speech. They have demanded legal action against those involved in the propagation of hate and violence. There is no specific legal definition of hate speech. Provisions in law criminalize speeches, writings, actions, science and representations that instigate violence and spread disharmony between communities and groups. These are understood to refer to hate speech. The Law Commission of India in its 267th report says, Hate speech generally is an incitement to hatred primarily against a group of persons defined in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious belief and the like. Thus, hate speech is any word written or spoken, signs, visible representations within the hearing or sight of a person with the intention to cause fear or alarm or incitement to violence. In general, hate speech is considered a limitation on free speech that seeks to prevent or bar speech that exposes a person or a group or section of society to hate, violence, ridicule or indignity. Sections 153A and 505 of the Indian Penal Code are generally taken to be the main penal provisions that seek to punish hate speech and which deal with inflammatory speeches and expressions. Under section 153A, promotion of enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony is an offence punishable with three years' imprisonment. It attracts a five-year term if committed in a place of worship or an assembly engaged in religious worship or religious ceremonies. Section 505 of IPC makes it an offence to make statements conducing to public mischief. The statement, publication, report or rumor that is penalized under section 505 subsection 1 should be one that promotes mutiny by the armed forces or causes such fear or alarm that people are induced to commit an offence against the state or public tranquility or is intended to incite or incites any class or community to commit an offence against another class or community. This attracts a jail term of up to three years. Under 505 subsection 2, it is an offence to make statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill will between classes. Under subsection 3, the same offence will attract up to a five-year jail term if it takes place in a place of worship or in any assembly engaged in religious worship or religious ceremonies. The law commission has proposed that separate offenses be added to the IPC to criminalize hate speech quite specifically instead of being subsumed in the existing sections concerning inflammatory acts and speeches.",156.4305622577667,"A religious conclave held between December 17 and 19, 2021 in Haridwar witnessed infremitry and provocative speeches by proponents of Hindutva, many of them leaders of religious organizations.

We will delve into the powerful ideas and insights shared by TED speakers around the world and their influence on global scale. As we know, TED Talks are famous for their compelling and inspiring storytelling, which makes learning more engaging and memorable for students and people in general, because speakers use it with narratives to come with complex ideas. Also, by making students more open-minded learners, we can accomplish sustainable developments for a goal, quality education, which is one of the essential part of society's well-being. Also, TED Talks empower students to share their own ideas and experiences, and by giving them wide range of ideas, they become more independent. Also, sustainable development is inherently global. TED Talks create windows into different cultures and global issues, fostering more interconnected worldview among students, which is also a perspective for sustainable development. Also, TED Talks create global learning community through educators and learners. This is also a perspective for quality education. By embracing the power of TED Talks, we can continue to enrich and transform the learning experience for everyone and educators alike. Through TED Talks, we not only reimagine education, but we also breathe life into a future where knowledge has no bounds and every talk becomes catalyst for a more enlightened and brighter world.

2024-01-27T10:33:23,2024-01-27T10:33:23," In college, I had to write a lot of papers. Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this. And I would want to do that. But then actually, the paper would come along, and then I would kind of do this. Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastiners were actually different than the brains of other people. And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator. And so I could compare them. So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator. Now, here's my brain. There is a difference. Both brains have a rational decision maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an instant gratification monkey. Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator? Well, it means everything's fine until this happens. So the rational decision maker will make the rational decision to do something productive, but the monkey doesn't like that plan. So he actually takes the wheel, and he says, actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan Tanya Harding scandal, because I just remember that that happened. The instant gratification monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel. He lives entirely in the present moment. He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things, easy and fun. Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, but other times, it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant for the sake of the big picture, and that's when we have a conflict. Turns out that the procrastinator has a guardian angel, someone called the panic monster. Now, the panic monster is dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up. Any time a deadline gets too close, or there's danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster, or some other scary consequence. But there's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline. So if you want to have a career where you want to be a self-starter, something in the arts, something entrepreneurial, there's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening at first, not until you've gone out and done the hard work to get some momentum to get things going. There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don't involve any deadlines, like seeing your family, or exercising and taking care of your health, working on your relationship, or getting out of a relationship that isn't working. Now, if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the panic monster, that's a problem, because in all of these non-deadline situations, the panic monster doesn't show up. And it's this long-term kind of procrastination that's much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier short-term deadline-based kind. And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness and regrets. I had a little bit of an epiphany. I don't think non-procrastinators exist. That's right. I think all of you are procrastinators. Now, you might not all be a mess, like some of us. And some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines. But remember, the monkey's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren't there. And we need to think about what we're really procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating on something in life. That's a job for all of us. And it's a job that should probably start today. Well, maybe not today, but... You know, sometime soon.",188.9279890060425,"Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this.

2024-01-27T10:36:15,2024-01-27T10:36:15," Cyberbullying by Vincent Persons. Another text message? What does this keep on happening? My topic is cyberbullying. The points I'll be addressing today is what is cyberbullying, maps that lead to cyberbullying, how it contributes to suicide, and how we can stop it. To start with, cyberbullying is using electronics or online resources to bully a person by sending a message of invitating or threatening nature. According to dosomething.org, 52% of young people report being cyberbullied. Kids and teens are now getting their own electronics and mobile devices at a younger age. They also have access to many social media sites that can share information of any individual. In addition, the data on pacers.org has shown that 81% of young people think that online bullying is the easier way to get away with it than doing it in person. Several sites' snaps like Yik Yak, Whisper, and Snapchat allow our users to set up anonymous accounts and post whatever they want. Some of these apps have features where the message can be automatically deleted after posting. This allows the victim to be harassed by the bully multiple times. Lastly, some kids have used those site snaps and get into hurtful bullying that have led to suicide and suicidal attempts. An article on familyandeducation.com states that the app, s.fm, was involved in the suicidal death of a 12-year-old girl Rebecca said she would come for her. DoSomething.org states that these bullying victims are 2-9 times more likely to consider committing suicide. How to stop it? Victims can perform CBR, copy, block, and report. Victims can copy or get a screenshot of the offending message before any deleting occurs. Next victim should block the bully on social media and mobile phone devices. Finally, and most importantly, report any and all harassing messages that are received. Reporting to authorities such as parents, teachers, and police can help you. Something recently happened to me where I was contacted by a person who got my phone number from one of my friends. This individual text and FaceTiming me harassing messages. I repeatedly told this person to stop. Then they began to use foul language in their messages. That's when I told my mom and she used CBR to make the situation end. In conclusion, cyberbullying cannot just hurt. It can kill. Missusing electronics or online resources to bully a person is not cool. Choose the app you use carefully and remember, copy, block, and report. Keep yourself safe. Hold on. I got another text. Oh, it's just my mom.",135.2197644710541,"The points I'll be addressing today is what is cyberbullying, maps that lead to cyberbullying, how it contributes to suicide, and how we can stop it.

As we are following the breaking news here, the world court will not throw out genocide charges against Israel for its military offensive in Gaza, but also will not order a ceasefire. Announcing its decision on the eve of International Holocaust Remembrance Day, the International Court of Justice, which you saw in that video, did demand that Israel try to contain death damage in its military offensive. That decision comes after South Africa asked the court to order Israel to halt its operations claiming genocide. The decision in the Netherlands by the 17 judges is considered to be an interim one, and it could take years for the full case brought by South Africa to be considered. Israel has rejected those genocide allegations and had asked the court to throw out the charges, as you heard there, the court did refuse to do. We did hear from Prime Minister Netanyahu in a quick minute statement that he did put out just a short time ago. I do want to play that for you here, raw and unfiltered, on Live Now from Fox. The National Holocaust Remembrance Day is a vital terror organization. On October 7th, Hamas perpetrated the most horrific atrocities against the Jewish people since the Holocaust, and it vows to repeat these atrocities again and again and again. Our war is against Hamas terrorists, not against Palestinian civilians. We will continue to facilitate humanitarian assistance and to do our utmost to keep civilians out of harm's way, even as Hamas uses civilians as human shields. That was Prime Minister Netanyahu there speaking in Israel this morning right after that decision was announced by the World Court, again the United Nations highest court saying they will not throw out those genocide charges against Israel. They will hear the case, but they did stop short of actually calling for a ceasefire and essentially said that Israel needs to do everything it can to stop the loss of life and damage there during its invasion of Gaza. Now in its fourth month, and of course starting there with the October 7th attacks by Hamas, a terrorist organization killing about 1200 possibly more people over in Israel and taking more than 200 people hostages. At last check, we know that more than 100 people are still being held captive by Hamas.",116.5749583244324,"I do want to take you back out to this video from a little bit earlier.

And you know what great persuaders make? They make good societies. And that's what this role needs. I think that it's totally crazy that all anyone ever talks about is games, TV shows, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bitmoji. I don't even know what that is. My brother just told me about it. WeChat, Kiki, Seraha, and I could go on forever. Studies have shown that some kids these days even spend six and a half hours on a screen a day. I think we should draw attention to this problem. However, not reading can even result in making your brain less active or engaged. Back over the past year, I've enjoyed reading Winnetu by Carl May, the Harry Potter series with eight books, Roldal series with 12 books, and the Invanted series with seven books, and many, many single books in between. Some I've liked less, some I've liked more, but they all took me for such an adventure. Ask my family members. I'm a truly unhappy child when I don't have a good book to read right next to me. I love reading in places like my bed, on the move while walking, in the toilets, in queues, in vehicles, but more importantly, at home. I hide behind various corners of my house so nobody can find me and make me do anything else. Once I even hid behind a flower pot, pretended to be the flower, not moving at all. Nobody could find me for ages. It was hilarious. I read everywhere. For all of you skeptical people out there, let me tell you, when you have a good book to keep you company, there is nothing better in the universe. It takes you to places where you can't go and that's to meet people you can't meet. Reading is love in action. The positives are endless. I usually never have to study for spelling tests and it makes my vocabulary so good that easily impresses any grown up. Sometimes the first thing I know is I've just had a short conversation with the grown up and the next thing I know is there's a room full of adults talking about me. I can't imagine my life without a book. What I'm comparing is the lost art of reading, writing, communicating and persuading that some are the great societal ills of the text message, the tweets and the snap. All these wonders of modern technology have their place. We, the young generation, have to hold on to reading. It's the cue to our kingdom. So go out there, find a good book, not just any book.

Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal. Imagine deciding right now that you're going to do it. Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do. Imagine their congratulations and their high image of you. Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud? Don't you feel one step closer already, like it's already becoming part of your identity? Well, bad news. You should have kept your mouth shut. Because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it. The repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen. Any time you have a goal, there are some steps that need to be done, some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it. Ideally, you would not be satisfied until you had actually done the work. But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it, psychologists have found that it's called a social reality. The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done. And then because you've felt that satisfaction, you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary. So this goes against the conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals, so they hold it to it. Hold us to it. So let's look at the proof. 1926, Kurt Lewin, founder of social psychology, called this substitution. 1933, Vera Mahler found when it was acknowledged by others, it felt real in the mind. 1982, Peter Gravolta wrote a whole book about this, and in 2009, he did some new tests that were published. It goes like this. 163 people across four separate tests. Everyone wrote down their personal goal. Then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room, and half didn't. And then everyone was given 45 minutes of work that would directly lead them towards their goal, but they were told that they could stop at any time. Now those who kept their mouth shut worked the entire 45 minutes on average, and when asked afterwards said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal. But those who had announced it quit after only 33 minutes on average, and when asked afterwards said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal. So if this is true, what can we do? Well, you could resist the temptation to announce your goal. You can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgment brings, and you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing. But if you do need to talk about something, you can state it in a way that gives you no satisfaction, such as, I really want to run this marathon, so I need to train five times a week and kick my ass if I don't, okay? So audience, next time you're tempted to tell someone your goal, what will you say? Exactly, well done. Oh, very funny. You got me. I changed it to a plus. We are Intel. Sponsors of tomorrow.",156.7506697177887,"For real, take a second, you've got to feel this to learn it.

However, plastic turns out to be incredibly bad for the environment even things that seem so small and insignificant like stickers on apples. The sticker, attempting to do good, often gets ripped off as they're not particularly tasty, gets wrought up into a neat ball and flicked on the street. Then the sticker on the street gets blown by the wind into the drain and the drain leads to the river and the river leads to the sea. This journey now becomes terrifyingly interesting as this sticker joins all of the other washed out to sea plastics. Now, this sticker, let's call him Jerry. He has a number of places he can now go. First is in the stomach of sea creatures, like let's say a cute sea turtle. Sea creatures often mistake plastic as food such as a yummy jellyfish and eat them which inevitably kills them. There are so many bits of pieces of plastic in the ocean, millions in fact. Now every eight out of ten sea birds have plastic in their stomachs, fish as well. This affects our food chain because we eat the plastic that they ate from earlier. Next, our little sticker can go to the ever so famous plastic beaches. This is a result of us dumping the eight million tonnes of plastic every year. By 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. Or Jerry can float past these plastic beaches to one of the five massive gyres. Sadly, Jerry gets pulled along to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the biggest of them all. Now the Great Pacific Garbage Patch consists of around 2.4 million tonnes and covers about 1.6 million square kilometres, which is two times bigger than Texas. So this apple sticker Jerry, if I threw him away, it would be like this. Now if the front row of you threw your stickers away, it would be like this. And if all of you threw your stickers on the ground, it would be like this. So sadly, I am not here to present a revolutionary item that can help save this massive problem that keeps on getting worse. But I am here to tell you a few small steps that can help save our future. Firstly, recycle. This will avoid us adding to the millions of tonnes of plastic that is floating around on our oceans. Now there is equivalent to 700 pieces of plastic per person, so recycle. Secondly, we can ban microplastics. Macroplastics are normally found in products such as toothpaste, body scrubs and face wash. You can personally avoid buying these items. Thirdly, you don't buy plastic bags. France is banning them and Rwanda has completely banned them. Why can't we? Fourth, say no straw. Do you really have to sip your drink through a plastic straw? And finally, reuse cups, containers and plastic bottles. It takes all of us to do these small steps to help save our future to create a better world. Thank you.",203.6787419319153,"I thought that when I threw the plastic bottle away, it was fine and that something so small can cause so much damage and harm to the environment.

Is that question, what's your name? No. Is that question, will you give me money? No. Is that question, do you love me? No, no, no. The most important conversation question is, there's actually two parts, what about you? How about you? When someone asks you about your weekend plans and you say a little reply, I'm going hiking, I'm not doing much, there might be an incredibly awful, awkward pause. What happens next? Well, this is where the most important question comes in. You can ask them, what about you? How about you? You can kind of imagine tossing a ball back and forth.

Instead of talking to you, random person, scrolling Facebook. Thanks for the click. You see, back in 2009, we all had these weird little things called attention spans. Yeah, they're gone. They're gone. We killed them. They're dead. I'm trying to think of the last time I watched an 18-minute TED talk. It's been years, literally years. So if you're giving a TED talk, keep it quick.

2024-01-27T11:15:04,2024-01-27T11:15:04," It's 12 am and I haven't actually started writing a big essay that is due tomorrow. Countless all-nighters, minutes staring at the blank Word document, knowing that by 8 am a thousand word essay had to lie on the desk of a teacher. These are moments we have all experienced. These moments of madness, despair, and even sometimes panic haunt our minds from September to May. Each year we tell ourselves that we will be better organized and that we will start our work when it is given to us. But who are we really kidding? Ourselves. We will never do it. We will always start our work at the last moment or make up countless excuses about why we didn't do it earlier. Between the time we know we have to start working and the time we actually do, we do activities we enjoy more. This is called procrastination. Procrastination affects all of us. Our parents get mad because we are walking like zombies around the house and our teachers get angry because no one anticipates homework anymore. However, my hope is that after having listened to my talk, you will understand why we procrastinate and how to overcome it. Adolescents are not completely responsible for the time they lose while procrastinating. In fact, their brain is not fully developed yet. It is more precisely their prefrontal cortex that is not fully developed yet. The prefrontal cortex is a part of the brain that is involved in organization and decision making. It is therefore no wonder that the adolescents procrastinate more than adults. Everyone goes through this stage and most people seem to be able to overcome procrastination in their early 20s. Apart from this, lack of interest can also increase procrastination. Everyone can recall a homework they just hated to do but still had to do. If you are not interested in something, you will tend to procrastinate more. Apart from lack of interest, fear of failure also increases procrastination. If you work very hard but still get bad grades, you will start wondering to yourself, why am I actually working? It is of no use and you will start procrastinating. Ironically, fear of success also leads to procrastination. If you put too much stress on your work and you want too good grades, then you will start procrastinating because you will be too scared to start working. Nevertheless, procrastination can be overcome by firstly being aware of it. You have to know you are procrastinating if you want to solve this problem. Look for moments when you are supposed to work but are actually watching Netflix. Secondly, you have to manage your time. Time management is very important if you want to overcome procrastination. You cannot overload your days because overloaded days generate extra stress and can actually increase procrastination. And finally, you have to stay motivated. Motivation is extremely important. Everyone has to set his or her own goals regarding the knowledge he or she wants to require. If you are motivated, you will not procrastinate. While I was writing about this topic and thinking about advice I could give to others, I realized that I was pretty bad at following this advice myself. I procrastinate a lot, which is ironic, considering the fact that I am raising awareness about it. Nobody is perfect, that is for sure. Even if you are aware of your flaws, it is still very hard to change them. However, I hope that with the tips I just gave you today and the development of your prefrontal cortex that you will be able to overcome procrastination little by little. Thank you. Thank you.

More than cars or the internet or even that little mobile device we keep talking about, the technology you're using the most almost every day is this, your tush. Nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day, which is more than we're sleeping at 7.7 hours. Sitting is so incredibly prevalent, we don't even question how much we're doing it. And because everyone else is doing it, it doesn't even occur to us that it's not okay. In that way, sitting has become the smoking of our generation. And of course there's health consequences to this, scary ones besides the waste. Things like breast cancer and colon cancer are directly tied to our lack of physical inactivity. 10% in fact on both of those. 6% for heart disease, 7% for type 2 diabetes, which is what my father died of. Now any of those stats should convince each of us to get off our Duffmore, but if you're anything like me, it won't. What did get me moving was a social interaction. Someone invited me to a meeting but couldn't manage to fit me into a regular sort of conference room meeting and said, I have to walk my dogs tomorrow, could you come that? It seemed kind of odd to do. And actually that first meeting I remember thinking I have to be the one to ask the next question because I knew I was going to huff and puff during this conversation. And yet I've taken that idea and made it my own. So instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent lit conference room meetings, I asked people to go on a walking meeting to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week. It's changed my life. But before that, what actually happened was I used to think about it as you could take care of your health or you could take care of obligations. And one always came at the cost of the other. So now several hundred of these walking meetings later, I've learned a few things. First, there's this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out of the box thinking. Whether it's nature or the exercise itself, it certainly works. And second and probably the more reflective one is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they're really not that way. And if we're going to solve problems and look at the world really differently, whether it's in governance or business or environmental issues, job creation, maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things be true. Because it was when that happened with this walk and talk idea that things became doable and sustainable and viable. So I started this talk talking about the tish.

2024-01-29T12:10:23,2024-01-29T12:10:23," Sleep is so important. We need it to live. And when we can't sleep, we're desperate for help. But lately, our fascination with sleep feels as if it's taken on an urgency. Do a quick internet search for sleep and you'll find a slew of articles about how to make your sleep perfect. New gadgets, fancy alarm clocks, stay away from blue light. There are lots of services, products, and advice columns that tell us we're sleeping wrong. Not enough. Not quality sleep. Wrong position. Even worse, you might find scary messaging, claiming that if you're not sleeping right, your life is going to be shorter. You're going to get all kinds of diseases. One of the biggest worries we have about our sleep is that we're not getting enough. And that anything less than seven hours a night means that we're doomed to bad health. Everything from high blood pressure to Alzheimer's disease. But there are two flaws with this kind of messaging. The first flaw is that it's not completely accurate. Seven to eight hours of sleep, while recommended for adults, is just an average. And while messages have to be simplified for health communication to the public, sometimes important nuances get lost. So yes, it's true that not getting enough sleep in the long term is associated with health problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and depression. But fixating solely on seven to eight hours ignores the fact that there's a range of sleep that people need. The duration of a good night's sleep can be different for different people. Some adults need eight, but some are just fine on six. The second flaw with this kind of doomsday messaging is that it can be counterproductive, especially for people who do have trouble sleeping. For instance, in 2019, it was estimated that 21% of adults in the U.S. were wearing sleep tracking devices, and that number is probably growing. And I get it. It's fascinating to see how much sleep you've gotten each night and to know what part of your night was spent in deep sleep or dreaming. But having all of that sleep data is causing some people to become obsessed with it. It's so much so that it's leading to a condition some call orthosomnia, a preoccupation with the constant need to achieve perfect sleep. And this condition, ironically, is causing more sleep problems. Now, orthosomnia might be an extreme example, but the anxiety of not getting enough sleep is keeping some of us up at night. So here's what some experts are saying. Stop fixating on the number, because that can lead to unrealistic expectations of sleep. According to Dr. Colleen Carney, a psychologist and the head of the Ryerson University sleep lab, the basic questions you should ask yourself are, do I feel reasonably well rested during the day? Do I generally sleep through the night without disturbances? Or if I wake, do I fall back asleep easily? Can I stay awake through the day without involuntarily falling asleep? If your answers are yes to all three, you probably don't need to worry about your sleep. And if you're struggling with your sleep, instead of buying expensive blue light filters or fancy sleep trackers, try talking with your doctor to make sure there aren't any medical conditions that need to be explored first. Then try evidence-based recommendations laid out by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. What's really cool is that there's a highly effective therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, or CBTI. It doesn't have any medications involved, and it has a really low failure rate.",219.513884305954,"But lately, our fascination with sleep feels as if it's taken on an urgency.

New gadgets, fancy alarm clocks, stay away from blue light. There are lots of services, products, and advice columns that tell us we're sleeping wrong. Not enough. Not quality sleep. Wrong position. Even worse, you might find scary messaging, claiming that if you're not sleeping right, your life is going to be shorter. You're going to get all kinds of diseases. One of the biggest worries we have about our sleep is that we're not getting enough. And that anything less than seven hours a night means that we're doomed to bad health. Everything from high blood pressure to Alzheimer's disease. But there are two flaws with this kind of messaging. The first flaw is that it's not completely accurate. Seven to eight hours of sleep, while recommended for adults, is just an average. And while messages have to be simplified for health communication to the public, sometimes important nuances get lost. So yes, it's true that not getting enough sleep in the long term is associated with health problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and depression. But fixating solely on seven to eight hours ignores the fact that there's a range of sleep that people need. The duration of a good night's sleep can be different for different people. Some adults need eight, but some are just fine on six. The second flaw with this kind of doomsday messaging is that it can be counterproductive, especially for people who do have trouble sleeping. For instance, in 2019, it was estimated that 21% of adults in the U.S. were wearing sleep tracking devices, and that number is probably growing. And I get it. It's fascinating to see how much sleep you've gotten each night and to know what part of your night was spent in deep sleep or dreaming. But having all of that sleep data is causing some people to become obsessed with it. It's so much so that it's leading to a condition some call orthosomnia, a preoccupation with the constant need to achieve perfect sleep. And this condition, ironically, is causing more sleep problems. Now, orthosomnia might be an extreme example, but the anxiety of not getting enough sleep is keeping some of us up at night. So here's what some experts are saying. Stop fixating on the number, because that can lead to unrealistic expectations of sleep. According to Dr. Colleen Carney, a psychologist and the head of the Ryerson University sleep lab, the basic questions you should ask yourself are, do I feel reasonably well rested during the day? Do I generally sleep through the night without disturbances? Or if I wake, do I fall back asleep easily? Can I stay awake through the day without involuntarily falling asleep? If your answers are yes to all three, you probably don't need to worry about your sleep. And if you're struggling with your sleep, instead of buying expensive blue light filters or fancy sleep trackers, try talking with your doctor to make sure there aren't any medical conditions that need to be explored first. Then try evidence-based recommendations laid out by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. What's really cool is that there's a highly effective therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, or CBTI. It doesn't have any medications involved, and it has a really low failure rate.",199.3361918926239,"Do a quick internet search for sleep and you'll find a slew of articles about how to make your sleep perfect.

2024-01-30T13:11:52,2024-01-30T13:11:52," Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com. Are you ready to practice speaking in English with me? Let's do it. What do you do? Where do you want to go? What's up to this weekend? Ooh, could you answer these questions in English? In today's English lesson, you will practice speaking with me about seven of the most common conversation topics in English. We will practice vocabulary, questions, sample conversation, plus you will have the chance to have a sample conversation, practice conversation with me too. Over the past year, I have made seven Speak With Me lessons, and today I have combined them all in a very useful lesson where you can practice them for the next two hours. To help you never forget what you've learned, I've created a gigantic free PDF worksheet using all of the vocabulary, phrases, questions, sample sentences, and some challenge questions so that you can never forget what you've learned. You can download this free PDF worksheet with the link in the description. All right, are you ready to get started? We're going to be talking about these topics today. So drum roll, let's get started with the first one, weekend plans. Are you ready to learn the most important conversation question of all time, at least according to me? Is that question, what's your name? No. Is that question, will you give me money? No. Is that question, do you love me? No, no, no. The most important conversation question is, there's actually two parts, what about you? How about you? When someone asks you about your weekend plans and you say a little reply, I'm going hiking, I'm not doing much, there might be an incredibly awful, awkward pause. What happens next? Well, this is where the most important question comes in. You can ask them, what about you? How about you? You can kind of imagine tossing a ball back and forth. The other person has asked you a question, what are you doing this weekend? They throw you the ball. Now you reply and you say, okay, I'm going hiking or I'm not doing much. You need to throw or toss.",121.7347905635834,"In today's English lesson, you will practice speaking with me about seven of the most common conversation topics in English.

Nelle ultime settimane ho pensato molto a come fare un video di conversazione che fosse in qualche modo un video interattivo. Mi sono incuriosita questa idea perché giro vagando su YouTube ho visto altre persone che parlano di lingua estraniere che insegnano lingua estraniere fare questo tipo di video. Però poi con il passare dei giorni, con l'arrivo delle vacanze, di Natale, ho lasciato un po' perdere questa idea. Quindi voi vi starete chiedendo e perché adesso hai deciso di fare questo video se avevi lasciato perdere questa idea? Perché qualche giorno fa ho ricevuto su Instagram un messaggio da uno studente che mi ha scritto per suggerirmi di fare un video così, mandando mi anche il link ad un video del canale English Fluency Journey che ovviamente sono andata a guardare anche per un po' di ispirazione. Perciò eccomi qui oggi a fare questo video con voi, spero che questa idea vi piaccia ma sicuramente mi farete sapere che cosa ne pensate qui sotto nei commenti. Che cosa facciamo in questo video? Proviamo a conversare sulla base di un breve dialogo che ho scritto e che voi vedrete sullo schermo. In questo breve dialogo ho cercato di riprodurre il più fedelmente possibile il parlato informale di una conversazione tipo tra due persone che si conoscono. La situazione è la seguente, due amici non si vedono da un po' di tempo e decidono di organizzare un'uscita futura per andare al cinema insieme. Questo video può esservi utile per lavorare sulla pronuncia, per lavorare sull'intonazione, per lavorare su alcune espressioni molto tipiche della conversazione informale e che magari sono nuove per voi. Prima di iniziare la nostra conversazione leggiamo insieme il dialogo completo. Ciao, è da un po' che non ci sentiamo. Che mi racconti di bello? Le solite cose. Invece tu? Tutto bene? Si, dai, tutto bene, grazie. Senti una cosa, che fai nel fine settimana? Niente, in realtà non ho programmi, perché io ho due biglietti per andare a vedere di Abolic sabato. Ti va di andarci insieme? Volentieri, a che ora? I biglietti sono per lo spettacolo delle 19. Perfetto, così magari facciamo operativo prima e mi racconti che hai fatto durante le vacanze. Andata, ci vediamo direttamente davanti al cinema? Si, facciamo così, davanti al cinema a Piazza Cavour, lì vicino c'è un locale carino per prenderci qualcosa prima. Va bene, allora grazie ancora per l'invito. Ci mancherebbe, a sabato. Adesso ci esercitiamo nella conversazione leggendo una battuta per uno. Inizio io. Ciao, è da un po' che non ci sentiamo.

Come è andata? Che venne apparso di questo piccolo esercizio di conversazione? Sono molto curiosa di sapere che cosa ne pensate nei commenti qui sotto.
